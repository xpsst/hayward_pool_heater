# Feature Tracker

## Current Focus

The tmp merge track is closed. The current hardware-test focus has moved from reboot isolation to supervised field validation and repeatable simulator-backed testing: ESP-IDF 5 RMT passive RX is stable on hardware, CONFIG_5 defrost eco/normal active TX is captured as reusable fixture evidence, and a first-class ESPHome simulator node can now replay fixture-derived playbooks through API-controlled entities. Analysis tooling remains the active support track for finding the remaining unknown frame content during field sessions.

## Testing Track

| ID | Feature | Status | Acceptance | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|------------|-------|
| TEST-010 | ESPHome compile fixtures | Done | Normal and pulse-debug ESP-IDF YAML fixtures validate and compile | See `tests/components/hwp/` |
| TEST-020 | Docker/devcontainer/CI runners | Done | POSIX, PowerShell, and GitHub Actions paths compile fixtures without tracked generated output | Docker remains CI default |
| TEST-030 | Python schema validation | Done | `climate.py` schema behavior covered by stdlib unittest | Runs in `./scripts/test-esphome.sh --local` |
| TEST-040 | Native C++ protocol harness | Done | Pure C++ tests run without ESP32 hardware, ESPHome runtime, FreeRTOS, or RMT | Covers inversion, checksums, and defrost/flow/restrict enum strings |
| TEST-050 | Protocol seam extraction | Done | Protocol helpers can be included by native tests without ESP32-only headers | Fan mode, enum strings, checksums, and inversion are covered in `protocol_core` |
| TEST-060 | Golden packet fixtures | Done | Curated `tmp/hwp` base/demo packets have a documented fixture format and checksum validation | Stored under `tests/fixtures/packets/`; frame decode/generate assertions continue under TST-034/TST-035/TST-052 |
| TEST-065 | Recent hardware log fixtures | Done | A small curated fixture set is extracted from the newest hardware log without importing full logs | `hwp_hardware_log_2025_06_24.json` covers representative unique RX/change packets from ignored `tmp/hwp/POOL_esphome_logs.log` |
| TEST-066 | Fixture-backed analysis CLI | Done | Analysis tooling can validate fixtures, parse logs, and prove fixture packets appear in hardware traces | `python -m analysis.hwp_analyze`; full recent log proves all valid hardware fixture packets |
| TEST-067 | Annotation window fixtures | Done | Manual tagger windows from hardware logs are parsed and curated into reusable proof fixtures | `hwp_annotated_fan_control_2024_11_01.json` covers F01/F02-F13 fan-control examples |
| TEST-068 | Packet read/write contracts | Done | Curated fan-control annotation fixtures prove observed read decode and passive write bytes | Annotation JSON now carries read/write expectations; native tests assert F01-F13 decode and command-byte mutation |
| TEST-069 | Runtime frame contracts | Done | Runtime frame structs match and parse the packet contracts | Adapter-backed native tests cover `FrameConf1/2/4/5` matching and F01-F13 parsing |
| TEST-071 | Passive runtime frame contracts | Done | Passive condition/status/clock/config frames match tracked fixtures and parsed fields agree with pure protocol helpers | Adapter-backed native tests cover `FrameConditions1/1B/2/2B/D`, `FrameClock`, `FrameConf3`, and `FrameConf6` |
| TEST-072 | ESP-IDF 5 RMT compile coverage | Done | Normal and pulse-debug ESPHome fixtures compile against the new RMT RX/TX driver path | Devcontainer compile confirmed ESP-IDF 5.5.4; Windows verification with ESPHome 2026.7.4 confirmed ESP-IDF 5.5.5 |
| TEST-073 | Active TX echo fixtures | Done | Successful active write/echo windows are tracked and validated as regression evidence | CONFIG_5 D06 defrost eco/normal commands and heater echoes validate checksums, source direction, requested bit value, and observed byte-4 normalization |
| TEST-074 | Annotated evidence inventory | Done | Tmp annotated logs and Arduino simulator packets are inventoried against tracked fixtures | Current scan found 65 annotation windows and 43 simulator packets; see `docs/protocol/evidence-inventory.md` |
| TEST-075 | Menu-to-packet protocol contracts | Done | Manual menu options map to frame/byte/encoding evidence before more active controls are added | `analysis/hwp_menu_map.py` and `docs/protocol/menu-packet-map.md` cover implemented F/D/R/U/H/S options |
| TEST-076 | CONFIG_1/CONFIG_3 demo command fixtures | Done | Demo command examples for R01-R07 and R09-R11 are tracked as menu-backed byte contracts | `hwp_demo_command_contracts.json` pins checksums, menu byte locations, and one-byte pairs where the source supports them |
| TEST-077 | CONFIG_1 extended setpoint regression | Done | R01/R02/R03 setpoints use extended temperature encoding through protocol helpers and runtime frames | Issue #11 regression fixture pins 33.5/34/35C edge bytes so high setpoints do not wrap to low single-digit values |
| TEST-078 | Fan edge annotation fixtures | Done | Remaining fan-control annotation edge values are tracked as read/write fixture contracts | F02 41.0, F03 15.5, F08 1, F10 coil source, F12 50, and F13 99/100 are now proven from the 2024-11-01 annotated hardware log |
| TEST-079 | Defrost demo command fixtures | Done | Demo command examples for D01, D05, and D06 are tracked as menu-backed passive byte contracts | `hwp_defrost_demo_command_contracts.json` pins simulator D01/D05/D06 checksums, menu byte locations, and one-byte pairs; live active-control claims remain limited to the D06 echo fixture |
| TEST-081 | COND_2 demo read fixture | Done | Remaining simulator `COND_2` temperature packet is tracked as passive read/decode evidence | `hwp_demo_packets.json` now includes `p_28`; native protocol and runtime frame tests assert outlet, coil, exhaust, and auxiliary temperature decode |
| TEST-082 | Firmware formatter contracts | Done | Packet headers and decoded field formatters keep stable alignment and changed-value highlighting for analysis logs | Native frame tests cover long/short header shape, inverse highlighting, and representative decoded formatters across config, condition, and clock frames |
| TEST-083 | GUI field annotator and packet viewer | Done | Field annotation can run from saved profiles and display parser-backed packet shapes during discovery | `requirements-annotator.txt` supports workstation setup; `python -m analysis.hwp_logs_annotator --setup` creates profiles in `.esphome-config/hwp-tools.json`; packet view uses shared parser, fixtures, and menu metadata |
| TEST-084 | GUI parsed-field dashboard | Done | Known packet fields render as latest-value dashboard rows and simple rolling trends during field sessions | Tk GUI now has Dashboard, Packets, and Graphs tabs; field decoding is shared/tested in `analysis.hwp_field_dashboard` |
| TEST-085 | GUI live log controls | Done | Field tool can change API log level, request dump-config refresh, and invoke restart when a restart button exists | Uses native API log resubscription and button command; no generic reboot is attempted without a restart button entity |
| TEST-086 | Firmware-served HWP web dashboard | Done | ESPHome devices with `web_server:` can serve a tablet-friendly HWP dashboard directly from `/hwp` | Optional `web_ui` config registers authenticated `/hwp`, `/hwp/state.json`, and `/hwp/events`; Values, Frames, Packets, and retained Graphs are read-only field-analysis views |
| TEST-087 | Firmware web annotation and capture tooling | Done | Tablet field sessions can mark browser-local annotations and regenerate web UI screenshots | `/hwp` annotations export JSON from localStorage; `python -m analysis.hwp_web_capture` captures phone/tablet/desktop screenshots; `analysis/README.md` documents regeneration and generated screenshot policy |
| TEST-088 | First-class ESPHome HWP simulator | Done | A separate ESP32 simulator node exposes API entities, fixture-derived playbooks, native engine tests, and an ESPHome compile fixture | `components/hwp_simulator/` drives playbook packets through software-timed open-drain GPIO pulses and is controlled through select/switch/number/button/text entities; user setup lives in `docs/hwp-simulator.md` |
| TEST-089 | Simulator RX/listen hardening | Done | Simulator listens for controller-originated packets, updates known config registries, and echoes changed registry packets | ESP-IDF 5 RMT RX is initialized before TX on the shared GPIO; heater TX repeats in protocol-shaped groups of four, `normal_idle` follows observed real-device packet cadence, repeated controller command groups are decoded/de-duplicated, CONFIG_1 through CONFIG_6 controller writes update replayed simulator state, only the first changed packet in a decoded burst is echoed immediately, diagnostics expose last RX/echo, and `hwp_sim_orchestrate transcript` records API entity updates as JSONL |
| TEST-070 | QEMU target test feasibility | Planned | Document install needs and prove one minimal ESP-IDF/ESP32 QEMU test app can run | Devcontainer has Debian `qemu-system-xtensa`, but not ESP-IDF or an ESP32 QEMU machine yet |
| TEST-080 | ESPHome host-platform feasibility | Blocked | Host compile/run path exists or blocker is documented | Current component is ESP32/RMT-bound |
| TEST-090 | Manual hardware-in-the-loop procedures | Done | Passive and active-control validation procedures are documented | See `docs/testing/manual-hil.md`; not default CI |
